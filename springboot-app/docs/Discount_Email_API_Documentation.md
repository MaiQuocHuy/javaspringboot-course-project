const response = await fetch('/api/discounts/email', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    discount_id: 'd1a2b3c4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890',

console.log(`Sent to ${result.data.estimatedRecipients} students`);
````

### Business Logic

1. **Discount Lookup**: Fetches discount details from database using provided ID
2. **Student Query**: Finds all users with role "STUDENT" and active status
3. **Email Generation**: Creates personalized emails using the discount-code-template with fetched discount data
4. **Bulk Sending**: Sends emails asynchronously with small delays to prevent provider overload
5. **Progress Tracking**: Counts successful sends and provides detailed logging
6. **Error Handling**: Continues sending even if some emails fail

### Technical Notes

- Discount details (code, start date, end date) are automatically fetched from database
- Emails are sent asynchronously to improve performance
- 100ms delay between emails to respect provider rate limits
- Template uses Thymeleaf for variable substitution
- Supports email provider fallback for reliability
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

### Advantages of New Design

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensures discount information is always current from database
2. **Simplified Frontend**: Frontend only needs to know discount ID and subject
3. **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates manual entry of discount code and dates
4. **Better Maintenance**: Changes to discount details don't require API updates

### Rate Limiting

- No explicit rate limiting on the API endpoint
- Email sending includes built-in delays to respect provider limits
- Recommended usage: Not more than once per day for promotional emails

### Monitoring

The API provides detailed logging for:

- Number of students found
- Email sending progress
- Success/failure counts
- Individual email send results
- Performance metrics
