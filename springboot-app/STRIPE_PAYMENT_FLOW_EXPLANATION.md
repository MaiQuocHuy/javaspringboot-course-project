# Stripe Payment Flow - Why Webhook Isn't Called

## üîç Current Situation Analysis

Based on your logs, you're seeing successful checkout session creation but no webhook processing. This is **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** because:

### What Your Logs Show:

```
‚úÖ POST /api/stripe/create-checkout-session - SUCCESS
‚úÖ Payment created with status: PENDING
‚úÖ Checkout session created: cs_test_a1r6nP4crO7rs0gOXqDk7IJvmqqp3S0Bij6oGMQGRT3EHhcyMHetsTRAhA
‚ùå No webhook processing (because customer hasn't paid yet)
```

## üìã Complete Payment Flow

### Phase 1: Session Creation (‚úÖ COMPLETED)

1. Customer clicks "Buy Course"
2. Your app calls `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`
3. Payment record created with status `PENDING`
4. Stripe checkout session created
5. Customer gets redirected to Stripe checkout page

### Phase 2: Customer Payment (‚ùå NOT DONE YET)

6. **Customer must complete payment on Stripe's page**
7. Stripe processes the payment
8. Stripe sends webhook to your `/api/stripe/webhook` endpoint

### Phase 3: Webhook Processing (‚ùå WAITING FOR PHASE 2)

9. Your webhook receives `checkout.session.completed` event
10. Payment status updated to `COMPLETED`
11. Enrollment created for the user

## üöÄ How to Test the Complete Flow

### Option 1: Complete Real Payment (Recommended)

1. Use the checkout URL from your response: `session.url`
2. Go to that URL in your browser
3. Complete the payment using Stripe test cards:
   - **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - Use any future date for expiry, any 3 digits for CVC

### Option 2: Use Test Endpoint (Development Only)

I've added a test endpoint for you:

```bash
POST /api/stripe/test-payment-success/{sessionId}
Authorization: Bearer <your-admin-token>
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/stripe/test-payment-success/cs_test_a1r6nP4crO7rs0gOXqDk7IJvmqqp3S0Bij6oGMQGRT3EHhcyMHetsTRAhA \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### Option 3: Use Stripe CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI and forward webhooks to local
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/stripe/webhook
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

## üîß Webhook Configuration Checklist

### 1. Stripe Dashboard Setup

- Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
- Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`

### 2. Environment Variables

```properties
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # From Stripe Dashboard
```

### 3. Local Development

For local testing, use ngrok to expose your localhost:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
# Use the ngrok URL in Stripe webhook configuration
```

## üêõ Debugging Enhanced

I've added enhanced logging to help you debug:

### New Webhook Logs Will Show:

```
========== STRIPE WEBHOOK RECEIVED ==========
üîÑ Processing Stripe webhook event...
üìù Payload length: 1234
üîê Signature header: Present
üí≥ Handling checkout session completed event: evt_...
‚úÖ Successfully processed webhook event: checkout.session.completed
```

## üìä Expected Database Changes After Successful Payment

### Before Payment (Current State):

```sql
-- PAYMENTS table
payment_id | status  | session_id
123        | PENDING | cs_test_a1r6nP4crO7rs0gOXqDk7IJvmqqp3S0Bij6oGMQGRT3EHhcyMHetsTRAhA

-- ENROLLMENTS table
(no enrollment record yet)
```

### After Successful Payment:

```sql
-- PAYMENTS table
payment_id | status    | session_id
123        | COMPLETED | cs_test_a1r6nP4crO7rs0gOXqDk7IJvmqqp3S0Bij6oGMQGRT3EHhcyMHetsTRAhA

-- ENROLLMENTS table
enrollment_id | user_id | course_id | status
456          | user-002| course-001| IN_PROGRESS
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test with real payment**: Use the checkout URL and test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
2. **Check webhook logs**: Look for the enhanced logging I added
3. **Verify database**: Check that payment status changes to COMPLETED
4. **Test enrollment**: Verify enrollment is created

## üí° Key Takeaway

**The webhook is NOT called when you create a checkout session. It's only called when the customer actually completes the payment on Stripe's checkout page.**

Your current implementation is working correctly - you just need to complete the payment flow!
