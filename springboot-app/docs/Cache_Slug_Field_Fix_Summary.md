# Cache Slug Field Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The course cache implementation was missing the `slug` field, causing inconsistency between cached and fresh database responses. This could lead to:
- Missing slug data in API responses when data is served from cache
- URL routing issues when slug is expected but not available
- Data integrity problems between cached and non-cached flows

## Files Modified

### 1. CourseCacheDto.java
**File**: `src/main/java/project/ktc/springboot_app/course/dto/cache/CourseCacheDto.java`
**Change**: Added `slug` field to the cache DTO structure

```java
// BEFORE
private String id;
private String title;
private String description;

// AFTER  
private String id;
private String title;
private String slug;  // ✅ ADDED
private String description;
```

### 2. CourseCacheMapper.java - toCacheDto() Method
**File**: `src/main/java/project/ktc/springboot_app/cache/mappers/CourseCacheMapper.java`
**Change**: Added slug mapping when converting Course entity to cache DTO

```java
// BEFORE
CourseCacheDto.CourseCacheDtoBuilder builder = CourseCacheDto.builder()
    .id(course.getId())
    .title(course.getTitle())
    .description(course.getDescription())

// AFTER
CourseCacheDto.CourseCacheDtoBuilder builder = CourseCacheDto.builder()
    .id(course.getId())
    .title(course.getTitle())
    .slug(course.getSlug())  // ✅ ADDED
    .description(course.getDescription())
```

### 3. CourseCacheMapper.java - fromCacheDto() Method  
**File**: `src/main/java/project/ktc/springboot_app/cache/mappers/CourseCacheMapper.java`
**Change**: Added slug restoration when converting cache DTO back to Course entity

```java
// BEFORE
Course course = new Course();
course.setId(cacheDto.getId());
course.setTitle(cacheDto.getTitle());
course.setDescription(cacheDto.getDescription());

// AFTER
Course course = new Course();
course.setId(cacheDto.getId());
course.setTitle(cacheDto.getTitle());
course.setSlug(cacheDto.getSlug());  // ✅ ADDED
course.setDescription(cacheDto.getDescription());
```

## Verification
- ✅ Code compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ Slug field added to cache DTO structure  
- ✅ Slug field properly mapped in both directions (entity ↔ cache)
- ✅ Maintains existing Lombok builder pattern
- ✅ Follows code organization patterns (slug placed after title field)

## Impact
- **Fixed**: Cache consistency issue where slug data was lost
- **Improved**: API response reliability for cached vs fresh data
- **Maintained**: Existing cache architecture and patterns
- **Preserved**: All existing functionality while adding missing field

## Cache Flow (After Fix)
1. Course entity → `toCacheDto()` → CourseCacheDto (with slug) → Redis
2. Redis → CourseCacheDto (with slug) → `fromCacheDto()` → Course entity (complete)
3. Course entity → API response (includes slug field)

This ensures slug field is preserved throughout the entire cache lifecycle.
